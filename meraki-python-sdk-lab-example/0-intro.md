# Introduction to the Meraki Python SDK

Software Development Kits (SDKs) enable developers to implement a platform's functionality quickly and easily without the need to dive into lower level functionality. Meraki provides a robust REST API, and it also provides an abstraction of those API calls through language-specific SDKs. This Lab introduces you to the Python SDK.

## Objectives

When you have completed this Learning Lab, you will be able to:

* Understand the Meraki Python SDK.
* Make baseline calls to get a list of Organizations, Networks, and Devices assigned to a network.

## Prerequisites

To complete this Lab, you should also have an understanding of these foundational topics:

* The previous Labs in the [Getting Started With Meraki](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/getting-started-with-meraki) Learning Lab Module. 
* Ability to read and understand Python code samples and scripts. You can explore the [Programming Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/programming-fundamentals) labs available on DevNet.
